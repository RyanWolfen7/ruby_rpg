# RUBY RPG

## Overview
---
This App is me practicing using Single Responsibility principles and Object Orientated Design. I don't expect anything to come from this repository, except increasing my coding proficiency.
Another thing to note is, I'm not using any Minimal Viable Product
design, this is completely free flow meaning no user stories, no
domain models, and no diagrams(at this point anyway). The idea is to increase proficiency with writing complex code.
